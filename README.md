# Group 1: Itinerary-sharing app MVP
An app for creating, sharing and discovering itineraries. Could incorporate social media features down the line, allowing you to share photos of your trips with friends while incorporating data from google maps/tripadvisor etc. to enrich the experience of viewing your journey. Users can follow in your footsteps by choosing to follow your itinerary, or any other itinerary available on the app, and have our app bring them along their chosen path.
